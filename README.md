# TensorFlowVideoClassificationTutorial

This tutorial demonstrates training a 3D convolutional neural network (CNN) for video classification using the UCF101 action recognition dataset. A 3D CNN uses a three-dimensional filter to perform convolutions. The kernel is able to slide in three directions, whereas in a 2D CNN it can slide in two dimensions. The model is based on the work published in A Closer Look at Spatiotemporal Convolutions for Action Recognition by D. Tran et al. (2017). In this tutorial, you will:

- Build an input pipeline
- Build a 3D convolutional neural network model with residual connections using Keras functional API
- Train the model
- Evaluate and test the model
